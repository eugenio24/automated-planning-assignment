# Problem 4

- `plansys2_assignment` folder contains all the source code for the plansys2 package 
- `plan`, `bt.xml`, the output plan and the Behavior Tree created by plansys2 (the ones it stores in `/tmp` folder)
- the two `.PNG` file are the screenshots of the execution in plansys2 

--- 

All the commands used to build/compile and execute the package are in `plansys2_assignment/README.md`.
